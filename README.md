Poketwo AutoBot

This specific selfbot was designed to automatically catch Pokemon spawned on Discord by PokeTwo bot. 

Features:

This bot exploits the hint feature of Poketwo bot to automatically identify the pokemon and subsequently catch it. Best when assigned to separate channel along with Dyno (prefix “?”) and Poketwo (“!”). This bot is very easy to use and does not need any knowledge of coding. Simply entering discord channel id(using developer mode) and authorization id(use inspect>network) will make it work.

Requirements:

•	Requires any software which can run python such as IDLE OR VS Code.

•	Requires to download discord library from command prompt.

•	Requires Discord account (preferably main and alt)

•	Requires private server(optional) and Dyno bot

Remarks:

The bot speed is intentionally slowed down to humane capabilities thus making it difficult to get detected since selfbots are disallowed by Discord TOS. It can be adjusted later however it is advised against.

Certain specific pokemons with symbols or emojis in their name such as male and female nidoran, farfetch’d, kommo-o line cannot be caught by the bot.
